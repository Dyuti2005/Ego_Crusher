“We don’t sugarcoat. We salt the wound.”
The Ego Crusher: The World’s Most Aggressively Useless AI 
Welcome to the future of recruitment—if the future was a total nightmare. The Ego Crusher is a satirical web experience built to replace "polite" HR tools with brutal, Neubrutalist honesty. While other apps try to get you hired, this one is a career assassin designed to make you delete your LinkedIn.

✨ Why is this project so "Useless"?
The Shy Button: Our "Submit" button is literally afraid of you. Using Framer Motion, it flees the cursor 5 times before letting you upload—because making a functional website was too mainstream.

The Digital Shredder: We don't "analyze" your resume; we shred it. Watch as our custom status feed mocks your life choices while "Locating Exaggerated Skills."
Chaos Mode: This is the only app that punishes you for using it. Stay on the results page for 30 seconds, and the UI explodes into a vibrating mess of "LOSER" and "REJECTED" labels.

Sad Confetti: Celebrate your failure with our exclusive black-and-gray "depressing" confetti effect upon downloading your 900-word rejection notice.

🎯 The Roast Engine
Our app parses your local PDF/TXT file using the FileReader API to generate 8+ savage analysis cards:
Maximum Copium Alert: Calling out your "leadership" skills.
The Boomer Test: Roasting you for listing Microsoft Word in 2025.
Red-Pen UI: All analysis features red-pen scribbles and annotations, making it look like a teacher who hates you graded your life.

🛠️ The Tech Behind the Trauma
Frontend: React 18, Vite
Styling: Tailwind CSS (Nuclear-Pastel Neubrutalism)
Animation: Framer Motion & Canvas-Confetti
Logic: JavaScript FileReader API
Hireability Success Rate: 0%. And we are damn proud of it.
