The Ego Crusher
“We don’t sugarcoat. We salt the wound.”
The Ego Crusher is a high-octane, satirical HR tool built to destroy the "polite" norms of the modern job market. It replaces boring AI-screening tools with a brutal, Nuclear-Pastel Neubrutalist experience that mocks your resume in real-time. Instead of a standard rejection email, users are put through a gauntlet of psychological warfare and comedic roasting.
